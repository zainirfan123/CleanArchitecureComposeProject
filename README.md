## Challenging Parts
1. ** Offline Mode Implementation **:
   # Challenge: 
        Ensuring that the application works seamlessly in offline mode, especially when handling different types of content (episodes, 
        series, courses, categories) and maintaining data consistency.
 
  #  Why it was challenging:
         Offline mode requires careful management of local storage, data synchronization, and handling edge cases where 
         data might be partially available.

## Future Improvements
  1. ** Dark and Light Theme Support **:
     -  Description: Implementing both dark and light themes to enhance user experience and provide better accessibility.
     -  Benefits: Improves usability in different lighting conditions and caters to user preferences.
